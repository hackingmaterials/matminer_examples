    "* The purpose of this tutorial is to provide examples of how to use different aspects of the materials data minining python package, [*matminer*](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer), from gathering the data to featurization, visualization and training machine learning models to predict materials properties. \n",

Do not worry as binder creates your own isolated environment so you are not really changing any source code. Alternatively, you can clone the [matminer_examples](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer_examples) Github repository to run these notebooks on your machine and also checkout the examples that are written in simple python script which are not shown here.\n",
